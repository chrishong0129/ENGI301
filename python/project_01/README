ENGI301 Project_01
Project Name: He's a Keeper
Project Owner: Christopher Hong
Date: Apr 4, 2022

This is a goalkeeper reflex training game modified from the classic Whac-a-mole game. 
There are 5 buttons incorporated, which are each fit into 3D-printed enclosures with suction cups.
Feel free to add male-female jumper wires if you want to position the buttons further away.

Each game will start with a 3-sec countdown and go through 20 rounds.
In each round, one of the 5 buttons will light up randomly with the buzzer. 
Hit the lit button as quick as possible! The display will show you how much time you took to hit it.
The time delay between each round is randomized, so be alert!
At the end of the game, the display will show you the average time you took to hit the correct button.

Project Name: He's a Keeper
Project Owner: Christopher Hong
Date: May 2, 2022

He's a Keeper is a goalkeeper reflex training game modified from the classic Whac-a-mole game. 
The circuit design of He's a Keeper was initially on a breadboard, but now will be replaced with a new PCB design.
Unfortunately, the PCB design was not completed in time.
The schematics are almost complete, but the layout still needs a decent bit of work to be done.

There are 6 buttons used that extend from the PCB in the center. 
Each button is fit into a 3D-printed enclosure with suction cups.
Feel free to add male-female jumper wires if you want to position the buttons further away.

Each game will start with a 3-sec countdown and go through 20 rounds.
In each round, one of the 6 buttons will light up randomly with the buzzer. 
Hit the lit button as quick as possible! The display will show you how much time you took to hit it.
The time delay between each round is randomized, so be alert!
At the end of the game, the display will show you the average time you took to hit the correct button.
There is a restart button on the PCB if you want to play another round!
